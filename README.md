# Sense2Stop: Smoking detection via hierarchical latent marked point processes  #

This project focuses on detection of smoking episodes. We use self-report and sensors to measure smoking episodes.  Time-varying covariates such as urge are measured via self-report.  Location (GPS) is measured via sensors.  Stress is measured both via self-report and sensors.  

## Project Description # #
This project includes the code needed to reproduce the results in the project 

"Mark it a Puff". If using this code please cite the paper using the following bibtex: 

```tex
@InProceedings{dempsey:2019,
author = {Dempsey, Walter},
title = {The Most Amazing Paper},
booktitle = {Best Conference},
year = {2019}}
```
The goal of this project is to do. 

## Code Description ##

If there are steps to run the code list them as follows: 

0. Dependencies. If there are any dependencies list them. 
1. Get the data
* Where is the data, who is in charge of it, how do they get it. 
* Are there preprocessing steps? If so what folder are they in, for example: [the data preprocessing directory](/data_preprocessing)
2. Run methods. Point people towards the folder with methods. [the methods directory](/methods)
3. Evaluate. Point people towards the folder with evaluation functions [the evaluation directory](/evaluation)

SOMETHING TO NOTE: Readmes are incredibly sensitive to spaces, if you are not sure why something isn't working double check the example and make sure you have the spacing right. 

Here is an example code block:

```
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=classpath.out
```
