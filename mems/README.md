# Measurements

This folder contains a series of scripts that checks how consistent the data streams are with each other. In particular, we investigate the following two questions:
(1) How well does HTMGs from puffMarker cover smoking events reported in other measurements? (2) How reliable are events reported in eod_ema in tracking smoking events reported in other measurements?

The three ipython notebooks that end with puffmarker in their names investigate the first question, while the ones that start with measurements investigate the second questions.

A comprehensive summary is contained in section 4 of datareport.pdf
