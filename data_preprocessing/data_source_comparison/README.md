# Data_Summary

This folder contains 5 ipython notebooks that analyze the differences between the original(cloud) data and the backup(phone) data for each of the data stream that we are interested in.

A comprehensive summary of the differences is contained in datareport.pdf. Few important observations:
there are participants that do not have certain data streams in the backup data; however, for those who do, the backup data is always a superset of the original data.
