# Sense2Stop: Smoking detection via hierarchical latent marked point processes  #

This file contains a list of questions that I have about the data set:

0. How do we interpret puff_feature files at all? We definitely need to email the people who created the data.
1. What is the column of "-360" in each file?
2. What are good ways to convert categorical responses to numbers?
3. There are questions that I believe the responses of which will be highly correlated. 
4. How do we handle the cases where some questions were left unanswered by the users?
5.
